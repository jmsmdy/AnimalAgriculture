# Format

Disease data is broken up by state (into folders). Within each state's folder, data is broken up into individual files for each disease.
Folders are labeled with the 2-character alpha code for each state (e.g. TX = Texas, NY = New York). Files are labeled in the form "XX_Disease.csv", where XX is the 2-character alpha code of the state, and Disease is the name of the disease. For reference, here are the current diseases in this data set, and corresponding animals which they are associated with:



 - STEC (Cows, Pigs)
 - Salmonellosis (Cows, Pigs, Chickens, Turkeys)
 - Campylobacteriosis (Chickens, Turkeys)



The columns have labels of the form "COUNTY" or "yyyy COUNT" or "yyyy RATE",
where yyyy is the given year.

 - "COUNT" refers to the total number of reported cases in that county in that year.
 - "RATE" refers to the number of reported cases in that county per 100,000 residents of that county.
